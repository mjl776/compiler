# How to test components in our application

Before testing any components of the application follow these steps 

1.  On a terminal window within the project root directory while on the main branch

    `git pull origin main`

2. Then on the branch you are working on run (if you did not just recently create the branch from main)

    `git merge origin main`

3. Then to test our application locally run 

    `npm start`
