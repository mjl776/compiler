# How to create a Post

When creating a post, the required fields are title, author, and post text 

## Title

The title should have a word limit of 20 characters

## Author 

The author should be same as the users username, as we optimize this, our author will be automatically filled in as we configure Auth0 to our database 

## Post text

The post text is unlimited as the blog post can contain as much post text as possible

In the future, we hope to create more option on how to style the text within a post
