# How to Sign Up

When signing up, simply fill in the fields provided such as first name, last name, username, password, github url (optional), linked in url (optional), and an instagram url (optional)

# Username

The username must be unique to every single user. As of now there's no minimum or maximum length or limit on character use for the username but it will soon be implimented 

# Password 

As of now the password doesn't have any restrictions so it can be as weak or as strong as the user wants. Moving forward we're planning on forcing users to only use passwords of a certain strength and above such as having a minimum required length and using both numbers and letters
