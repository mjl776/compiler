# How to Sign In

Enter your email that is linked to your account into the email box, and enter your password into the password box. Then, you will be signed in.

# Email

At the moment the user needs to use their email to log-in because we are using firebase as our authentiaction platform for log in information, we are considering giving the user the option to use either their email or their username to log in.

# Password

Refer to signUP_README.md for information on the users' passwords.
