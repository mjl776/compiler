### AWS Tech Stack and Implementation


1. AWS S3 Bucket: We used the react-aws-s3 package to push images online to the compiler-images bucket on Amazon AWS S3. 

2. We modified the CORS file on the bucket page. 

3. Environment keys were added to the .env page. 

4. The final logic was added to aws.tsx.
